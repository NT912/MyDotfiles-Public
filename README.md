    make install

CMake hints for inspecting the build:

- `cmake --build build --target help` lists all build targets.
- `build/CMakeCache.txt` (or `cmake -LAH build/`) contains the resolved values of all CMake variables.
- `build/compile_commands.json` shows the full compiler invocations for each translation unit.
